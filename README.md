🌦️ Weather Data Analysis Dashboard (2020–2024)
This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard developed to analyze comprehensive weather data across multiple districts and mandals from 2020 to 2024. The dataset includes key meteorological variables such as rainfall (mm), temperature (min/max °C), humidity (min/max %), and wind speed (min/max Kmph) collected at district and mandal levels.
